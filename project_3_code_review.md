## Clean Code & Good Documentation

- Code follows PEP-8
- Very readable and easy to follow
- In your README.md, provide a clear scope and analysis, methodology, data science methods used, and summary of your findings. 
- Use more markdown cells and inline code comment
- Move your modeling process to py files

## Proper Data Science:

- Great work walking through all the algos
- When you have the chance, take the time to try to tune parameters.  

## Comments:

- Loved project 3 :). Turned out to be a fantastic project. 
- Would love to see how the groovy recommendation from an artist compare to their top rated/played songs.
